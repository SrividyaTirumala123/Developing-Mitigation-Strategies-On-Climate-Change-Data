# Climate Change Mitigation Strategies

This project visualizes two important strategies for mitigating climate change:

1. Carbon Sequestration through land usage  
2. Renewable Energy Adoption over time

It uses analytical methods to interpret these trends.

- Correlation Analysis â€“ Understanding the relationship between land area and carbon absorption rate.  
- Trend Analysis â€“ Observing how renewable energy usage grows over the years.  
- Impact Analysis â€“ Evaluating how land-based and energy-based strategies can reduce carbon emissions over time.

## ðŸ“Š Visualizations

1. **Carbon Sequestration vs Land Area**  
   - Displays estimated COâ‚‚ absorbed (in tons/year) for different land areas.  
   - Helps assess how increased afforestation can capture more atmospheric carbon.

2. **Renewable Energy Adoption Over Time**  
   - Simulates a year-wise increase in renewable energy usage.  
   - Highlights long-term benefits of consistent adoption strategies.
