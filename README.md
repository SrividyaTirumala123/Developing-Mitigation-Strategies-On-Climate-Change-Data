# Climate Change Mitigation Strategies

This project visualizes two important strategies for mitigating climate change:

1. Carbon Sequestration through land usage  
2. Renewable Energy Adoption over time

It provides insights into how expanding green cover and increasing renewable energy usage can impact climate positively. The project uses real-world analytical methods to interpret these trends.

## 📊 Visualizations

1. **Carbon Sequestration vs Land Area**  
   - Displays estimated CO₂ absorbed (in tons/year) for different land areas.  
   - Helps assess how increased afforestation can capture more atmospheric carbon.

2. **Renewable Energy Adoption Over Time**  
   - Simulates a year-wise increase in renewable energy usage.  
   - Highlights long-term benefits of consistent adoption strategies.

##  Technologies Used

- Correlation Analysis – Understanding the relationship between land area and carbon absorption rate.  
- Trend Analysis – Observing how renewable energy usage grows over the years.  
- Impact Analysis – Evaluating how land-based and energy-based strategies can reduce carbon emissions over time.
